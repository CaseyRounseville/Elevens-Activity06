1. possible combinations:
     5-6
     5-6(there are 2 fives)
2. No, because if the deck is shuffled in just the right way, on the first deal whe n the cards are put on the table, 
   there could be a king,queen, and a jack. If the player removes them and replaces them with three new cards, the three
   new cards could be a king, queen, and a jack. This could repeat until there are no more kings, queens, or jacks in 
   the deck. If this happens, the last 3 cards won't be kings, queens, or jacks because there aren't anymore of them in 
   the deck.
3. There might be some strategy in the game if the player is thinking about how many of each card are still in the deck
   when they are choosing which cards to remove. The player could think about the chances of another card being next so it 
   can add up to 11 and remove another card so they have a chance to get another card on the table to take off 3 cards if 
   they could remove a king, queen, and jack with the new card.
